LAGOON DEPLOYMENT
-----------------
See the docs for [lagoonizing a project](https://git.acromedia.com/acro/code/standards/-/wikis/lagoonize)

### Lagoon Deployment Rollout Tasks

If you created you project using acromedia/drupal-recommended your site will come with rollout tasks setup but commented out.
The reason for this is they will not work until you have setup the DB.



See `.lagoon.yml`
